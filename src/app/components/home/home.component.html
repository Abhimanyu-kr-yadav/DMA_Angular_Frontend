              Let’s assume people love your brand. But the digital experience? Meh. This perception of your company’s ability (or lack thereof) to deliver in today’s “on demand” economy can be a deal breaker, making your brand an easy target for the competition. Tech savvy consumers are getting more finicky by the day. With the world at everyone’s fingertips, the bar gets set higher to win customers’ hearts and wallets.

              But this is easier said than done. Recently, many brick and mortar retail channels have slowed to a grinding halt, yielding to digital as the primary channel for consumers to reach their brands. Times like these have enabled innovators like Amazon to surge even further ahead of the bunch.  As a result, it has never been more crucial for brands to stand out from the crowd, investing in the people, tools, infrastructure to build frictionless digital experiences, and then scaling and optimizing to make customers want to come back again and again.
              
              But how can you deliver on your brand promise and make technology a differentiator? The answer comes down to customer experience (CX) and agility. Companies must increasingly reimagine the entire customer journey again and again with increasing speed to market. The ones who have figured out how to be truly data-driven and accelerate customer insights and business decisions are more likely to emerge ahead.
              
              But where in the digital enterprise does this magic take place? This intersection of CX and agility increasingly occurs with a new type of operations. Enter the digital operations team.

              The birth of digital operations
              Before the web, brick and mortar operations departments were sometimes perceived as dull, repetitive or lacking creativity and innovation. Operations groups in large manufacturing companies were about managing supply chains with efficiency and automation, but they were not yet “digitized.” The marketing, finance and IT departments may have been more appealing places to grow your career.
              
              Even in the early days of the web, the concept of a “digital operations” team barely existed. Early websites for large brands tended to live within the overall sales and marketing function. There were a few basic job functions, such as marketing, SEO, UX, content, and metrics, along with more technical functions like web development and information architecture.
              
              As digital adoption grew and scaled exponentially, the “eCommerce” or “digital” group often spun off into its own P&L and business unit. Soon, new functions appeared, like A/B testing, mobile, emerging tech, personalization and platform.
              
              The concept of a “digital operations” team emerged by default within large enterprises to address gaps in support for pre-existing operations functions and sales channels that were seeing increased demand for more tech savvy skill sets. A perfect example of this is the traditional call center, where customers were calling and emailing to complain about issues on the web site, when call center agents were barely trained to support it. While business phone systems are a solid option for providing other types of customer support in case they have a quick question, they need careful integration with website technology to handle UX issues effectively.
              
              Shortly thereafter, user acceptance testing and QA teams were moved into digital operations, along with agile delivery, program management, platforms and content. Pretty soon, a bevy of digital support roles were being relocated into digital operations, and suddenly digital ops was born, with no clear definition of ths
